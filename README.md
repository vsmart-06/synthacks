# Daily Optimizer

The repository to store the files for the Greenwood High Synthacks 2022 project - the Daily Optimizer

## Structure
2 apps - desktop ~~and mobile~~

App features: 

- [x] Text summarizer
- [x] To Do list
- [ ] Calendar
- [ ] Reminders
- [x] Spam filter

## Result

The app features a to do list that is specific to your account. Your account is protected by a username and password. The app will store your tasks - both completed and not completed - and will display them to you everytime you login. Multiple accounts can be made and the tasks will be stored independent of each other in each account.

We also have a software that can summarize a large block of text into a small part with <= 150 words. This will help optimize your daily workflow as you will not have to read the entire text but would only have to read the summary of the entire thing. This feature has been developed using machine learning and is **not** featured in the app.

There is also software that will tell you if a particular mail is a spam mail or not. This will also help optimize your workflow as you won't have to go through mails that only serve the purpose of wasting your time. This feature has also been developed using machine learning and is **not** featured in the app.
